### ﻿11.8.1 Type definitions

Type definitions bind type constructors to data types: either variant types,
record types, type abbreviations, or abstract data types. They also bind the
value constructors and record fields associated with the definition.

Type definitions are introduced by the type keyword, and consist in one or
several simple definitions, possibly mutually recursive, separated by the and
keyword. Each simple definition defines one type constructor.

A simple definition consists in a lowercase identifier, possibly preceded by
one or several type parameters, and followed by an optional type equation,
then an optional type representation, and then a constraint clause. The
identifier is the name of the type constructor being defined.

    
    
    type colour =
      | Red | Green | Blue | Yellow | Black | White
      | RGB of {r : int; g : int; b : int}
    
    type 'a tree = Lf | Br of 'a * 'a tree * 'a;;
    
    type t = {decoration : string; substance : t'}
    and t' = Int of int | List of t list
    

In the right-hand side of type definitions, references to one of the type
constructor name being defined are considered as recursive, unless type is
followed by nonrec. The nonrec keyword was introduced in OCaml 4.02.2.

The optional type parameters are either one type variable '
[ident](lex.html#ident), for type constructors with one parameter, or a list
of type variables ('[ident](lex.html#ident)1,…,'[ident](lex.html#ident)n), for
type constructors with several parameters. Each type parameter may be prefixed
by a variance constraint + (resp. -) indicating that the parameter is
covariant (resp. contravariant), and an injectivity annotation ! indicating
that the parameter can be deduced from the whole type. These type parameters
can appear in the type expressions of the right-hand side of the definition,
optionally restricted by a variance constraint ; _i.e._ a covariant parameter
may only appear on the right side of a functional arrow (more precisely,
follow the left branch of an even number of arrows), and a contravariant
parameter only the left side (left branch of an odd number of arrows). If the
type has a representation or an equation, and the parameter is free (_i.e._
not bound via a type constraint to a constructed type), its variance
constraint is checked but subtyping _etc._ will use the inferred variance of
the parameter, which may be less restrictive; otherwise (_i.e._ for abstract
types or non-free parameters), the variance must be given explicitly, and the
parameter is invariant if no variance is given.

The optional type equation = [typexpr](types.html#typexpr) makes the defined
type equivalent to the type expression [typexpr](types.html#typexpr): one can
be substituted for the other during typing. If no type equation is given, a
new type is generated: the defined type is incompatible with any other type.

The optional type representation describes the data structure representing the
defined type, by giving the list of associated constructors (if it is a
variant type) or associated fields (if it is a record type). If no type
representation is given, nothing is assumed on the structure of the type
besides what is stated in the optional type equation.

The type representation = [|] constr-decl { | constr-decl } describes a variant type. The constructor declarations constr-decl1, …, constr-decln describe the constructors associated to this variant type. The constructor declaration [constr-name](names.html#constr-name) of [typexpr](types.html#typexpr)1 * … * [typexpr](types.html#typexpr)n declares the name [constr-name](names.html#constr-name) as a non-constant constructor, whose arguments have types [typexpr](types.html#typexpr)1 …[typexpr](types.html#typexpr)n. The constructor declaration [constr-name](names.html#constr-name) declares the name [constr-name](names.html#constr-name) as a constant constructor. Constructor names must be capitalized.

The type representation = { field-decl { ; field-decl } [;] } describes a
record type. The field declarations field-decl1, …, field-decln describe the
fields associated to this record type. The field declaration [field-
name](names.html#field-name) : [poly-typexpr](types.html#poly-typexpr)
declares [field-name](names.html#field-name) as a field whose argument has
type [poly-typexpr](types.html#poly-typexpr). The field declaration mutable
[field-name](names.html#field-name) : [poly-typexpr](types.html#poly-typexpr)
behaves similarly; in addition, it allows physical modification of this field.
Immutable fields are covariant, mutable fields are non-variant. Since OCaml
5.4, mutable fields may be marked [@atomic] for concurrent access, see
[9.7.2](parallelism.html#s%3Aatomic-record-fields).  
Both mutable and immutable fields may have explicitly polymorphic types. The
polymorphism of the contents is statically checked whenever a record value is
created or modified. Extracted values may have their types instantiated.

The two components of a type definition, the optional equation and the
optional representation, can be combined independently, giving rise to four
typical situations:

Abstract type: no equation, no representation.

       
When appearing in a module signature, this definition specifies nothing on the
type constructor, besides its number of parameters: its representation is
hidden and it is assumed incompatible with any other type.

Type abbreviation: an equation, no representation.

       
This defines the type constructor as an abbreviation for the type expression
on the right of the = sign.

New variant type or record type: no equation, a representation.

       
This generates a new type constructor and defines associated constructors or
fields, through which values of that type can be directly built or inspected.

Re-exported variant type or record type: an equation, a representation.

       
In this case, the type constructor is defined as an abbreviation for the type
expression given in the equation, but in addition the constructors or fields
given in the representation remain attached to the defined type constructor.
The type expression in the equation part must agree with the representation:
it must be of the same kind (record or variant) and have exactly the same
constructors or fields, in the same order, with the same arguments. Moreover,
the new type constructor must have the same arity and the same type
constraints as the original type constructor.

The type variables appearing as type parameters can optionally be prefixed by
+, -, +-, or -+ to indicate that the type constructor has a specific variance
with respect to this parameter. A parameter prefixed with + is covariant, one
prefixed with - is contravariant. A parameter can be both covariant and
contravariant, also known as bivariant, with either a +- or -+ prefix. This
variance information is used to decide subtyping relations when checking the
validity of :> coercions (see section [11.7.7](expr.html#ss%3Aexpr-
coercions)).

For instance, type +'a t declares t as an abstract type that is covariant in
its parameter; this means that if the type τ is a subtype of the type σ, then
τ t is a subtype of σ t. Similarly, type -'a t declares that the abstract type
t is contravariant in its parameter: if τ is a subtype of σ, then σ t is a
subtype of τ t. If no + or - variance annotation is given, the type
constructor is assumed non-variant in the corresponding parameter. For
instance, the abstract type declaration type 'a t means that τ t is neither a
subtype nor a supertype of σ t if τ is subtype of σ.

The variance indicated by the + and - annotations on parameters is enforced
only for abstract and private types, or when there are type constraints.
Otherwise, for abbreviations, variant and record types without type
constraints, the variance properties of the type constructor are inferred from
its definition, and the variance annotations are only checked for conformance
with the definition.

Injectivity annotations are only necessary for abstract types and private row
types, since they can otherwise be deduced from the type declaration: all
parameters are injective for record and variant type declarations (including
extensible types); for type abbreviations a parameter is injective if it has
an injective occurrence in its defining equation (be it private or not). For
constrained type parameters in type abbreviations, they are injective if
either they appear at an injective position in the body, or if all their type
variables are injective; in particular, if a constrained type parameter
contains a variable that doesn’t appear in the body, it cannot be injective.

The construct constraint ' [ident](lex.html#ident) =
[typexpr](types.html#typexpr) allows the specification of type parameters. Any
actual type argument corresponding to the type parameter
[ident](lex.html#ident) has to be an instance of [typexpr](types.html#typexpr)
(more precisely, [ident](lex.html#ident) and [typexpr](types.html#typexpr) are
unified). Type variables of [typexpr](types.html#typexpr) can appear in the
type equation and the type declaration.

### ﻿11.8.2 Exception definitions

| exception-definition| ::=|  exception constr-decl  
---|---|---  
 | ∣|  exception [constr-name](names.html#constr-name) = [constr](names.html#constr)  
  
Exception definitions add new constructors to the built-in variant type `exn`
of exception values. The constructors are declared as for a definition of a
variant type.

# exception E of int * string;;

exception E of int * string

The form exception constr-decl generates a new exception, distinct from all
other exceptions in the system. The form exception [constr-
name](names.html#constr-name) = [constr](names.html#constr) gives an alternate
name to an existing exception.

# exception E of int * string exception F = E let eq = E (1, "one") = F (1,
"one");;

exception E of int * string exception F of int * string val eq : bool = true
